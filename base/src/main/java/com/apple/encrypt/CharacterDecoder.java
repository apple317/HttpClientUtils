/**
 * 37 * This class defines the decoding half of character encoders. 38 * A
 * character decoder is an algorithim for transforming 8 bit 39 * binary data
 * that has been encoded into text by a character 40 * encoder, back into
 * original binary form. 41 * 42 * The character encoders, in general, have been
 * structured 43 * around a central theme that binary data can be encoded into
 * 44 * text that has the form: 45 * 46 *
 *
 * <pre>
 *    47    *      [Buffer Prefix]
 *    48    *      [Line Prefix][encoded data atoms][Line Suffix]
 *    49    *      [Buffer Suffix]
 *    50    *
 * </pre>
 *
 * 51 * 52 * Of course in the simplest encoding schemes, the buffer has no 53 *
 * distinct prefix of suffix, however all have some fixed relationship 54 *
 * between the text in an 'atom' and the binary data itself. 55 * 56 * In the
 * CharacterEncoder and CharacterDecoder classes, one complete 57 * chunk of
 * data is referred to as a <i>buffer</i>. Encoded buffers 58 * are all text,
 * and decoded buffers (sometimes just referred to as 59 * buffers) are binary
 * octets. 60 * 61 * To create a custom decoder, you must, at a minimum, overide
 * three 62 * abstract methods in this class. 63 *
 * <DL>
 * 64 *
 * <DD>bytesPerAtom which tells the decoder how many bytes to 65 * expect from
 * decodeAtom 66 *
 * <DD>decodeAtom which decodes the bytes sent to it as text. 67 *
 * <DD>bytesPerLine which tells the encoder the maximum number of 68 * bytes per
 * line. 69 *
 * </DL>
 * 70 * 71 * In general, the character decoders return error in the form of a 72
 * * CEFormatException. The syntax of the detail string is 73 *
 *
 * <pre>
 *    74    *      DecoderClassName: Error message.
 *    75    *
 * </pre>
 *
 * 76 * 77 * Several useful decoders have already been written and are 78 *
 * referenced in the See Also list below. 79 * 80 * @author Chuck McManis 81 * @see
 * CEFormatException 82 * @see CharacterEncoder 83 * @see UCDecoder 84 * @see
 * UUDecoder 85 * @see BASE64Decoder 86
